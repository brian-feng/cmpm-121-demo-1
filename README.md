This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

D1.d:

For my first change, I learned how to use images in TypeScript with the help of this lovely project: https://github.com/scso-ucsc/Incremental-Game-Development
I borrowed their code for importing an image, and revised it with my own spin. My picture of Arnold Schwartznegger gets bigger the more gains you have, which is
something I made on my own. Specifically, I used their declarations.d.ts file to help me compile my project, and their method of setting image sources by importing.

Here's a link to the image I used.

For my second change, I borrowed from https://github.com/Herrerasaurus/cmpm-121-demo-1, who apparently took inspiration from https://github.com/6YuQing6/cat-fishing-cmpm121-demo1*/ this project for the cursor idea. I have replaced their bread emoji with this more thematically cohesive lifting emoji: üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Aside from that, I have borrowed a majority of the implementation from the above project, setting the mouse cursor to something different everywhere in the project.
